## Pandas data frame compiler

We implement CJT as a Pandas data frame compiler for ML task (currently only linear regression and ridge regression is supported). 

Please check the data_augmentation_demo.ipynb notebook for model training, model evaluation and machine learning augmentation.

Note that the run time performance and model performance will be different from the paper. This is because we use a smaller version of Favorita Dataset (as Github has a repository file size limit)
