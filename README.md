# CJT_Experiments

## Running CJT

We have implemented three versions of \cjt: as a custom C++ query engine that uses worst-case optimal join, as a middleware compiler for cloud databases (Redshift), a compiler to Pandas data frame operations.  We use them to study the above questions. Please see each directory for details.
